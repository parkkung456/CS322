            <greenbold>A new global plastics treaty could help us slash pollution. Here&rsquo;s how you can do your part.</greenbold><br></br>
            <p class="normal">Recycling is a key component of sustainable living, but many of us aren't sure what can and can't be recycled when we head to the rubbish bin each day. And, according to one expert, laziness isn't the only reason.</p>
            <p class="normal">Sustainability advisor Nick Torday says recycling systems are difficult to understand and &ldquo;broken&rdquo;.</p>
            <p class="normal">&ldquo;This is not an issue for nuanced debate, it is fact,&rdquo; he told Euronews Green in 2022. He explained that in the UK the government claims 46 per cent of household plastic waste is recycled, which is a gross overestimation.</p>
            <p class="quote">&ldquo; Recycling systems are difficult to understand and &ldquo;broken&rdquo;.</p>
            <p class="normal">Last year the UN approved a landmark agreement to create the world's first-ever global plastic pollution treaty. Off the back of this &ldquo;significant&rdquo; agreement, a &ldquo;fundamental systematic overhaul to plastic design, production and consumption&rdquo; was needed, Torday said at the time.</p>
            <p class="normal">That may now be within reach. Last week, 170 countries gathered in Paris to discuss making the treaty legally binding.</p>
            <p class="normal">By November this year, they plan to develop a first draft that will help curb plastic pollution by the end of 2024.</p>
            <p class="normal">Recycling is one system that needs to be improved. Just 8 per cent of people in the UK think that recycling labels are clear, according to YouGov - and that leads to a lot of Googling from confused consumers.</p>
            <greenbold>What are the most frequently searched household items?</greenbold>
            <p class="normal">Packing company &lsquo;Lifestyle Packaging&rsquo; looked at search data from Google to discover which items we are most confused about. </p>
            <p class="normal">Then they laid out exactly when these items can and can't be recycled. Read on for a handy guide to pin up in your kitchen.</p>
            <greenless>Can I recycle polystyrene? - 112,000 searches</greenless>
            <center><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/55/21/08/1920x1080_cmsv2_ab5855c5-93d4-516b-96ba-8d697646d144-6552108.jpg" id="sub_pic"></img></center>
            <p class="normal">You can recycle polystyrene but not at home. It is a complicated process and in many countries that means it can't be done on a local scale.</p>
            <p class="normal">Even if your local authority says it will take it, it's unlikely that it will end up being recycled.</p>
            <p class="normal">One solution is to try to limit the amount you collect or find creative ways to reuse it. Another is to ask online retailers to stop using polystyrene as packaging, as their use of it accounts for a large percentage of all uses.</p>
            <greenless>Can I recycle coffee pods? - 73,600 searches</greenless>
            <center><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/55/21/08/1920x1080_cmsv2_c57cb39e-8195-506c-a2cc-2151c7a279e8-6552108.jpg" id="sub_pic"></img></center>
            <p class="normal">Coffee pods are another everyday item that can theoretically be recycled, but not in your bins at home. Their small size and light weight make them difficult to deal with and the coffee grounds can contaminate the rest of your recycling.</p>
            <p class="normal">The best solution here is to ditch coffee pods altogether. </p>
            <p class="normal">But if you have no choice but to use them, buy the ones that are home compostable, and ask your workplace to opt for the same. These can be added to garden or food waste where they will naturally degrade.</p>
            <greenless>Can I recycle crisp packets? - 31,200 searches</greenless>
            <center><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/55/21/08/1920x1080_cmsv2_b072bb97-d7e0-5252-ad01-82cd04a8dc88-6552108.jpg" id="sub_pic"></img></center>
            <p class="normal">Though they often have a recycling symbol on the outside of the multi-pack, individual crisp packets are not recyclable at home.</p>
            <p class="normal">Empty packets can often be dropped off at local recycling points which can be found at many supermarkets.</p>
            <greenless>Can I recycle Tetra Pak (cardboard cartons)? - 28,000 searches</greenless>
            <center><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/55/21/08/1920x1080_cmsv2_59776744-dba5-52bb-9a72-1107fe8d6e9a-6552108.jpg" id="sub_pic"></img></center>
            <p class="normal">These cardboard cartons, like juice boxes, can be recycled but only in certain areas. Tetra Paks are made from up to 90 per cent paperboard but have an aluminium foil liner and plastic cap that can make the recycling process more difficult.</p>
            <p class="normal">If your local area doesn't offer Tetra Pak recycling, they can often be dropped off at supermarket collection points or council-run recycling centres.</p>
            <greenbold>What is &lsquo;wishcycling&rsquo;?</greenbold>
            <p class="normal">If you are ever unsure about whether an item can be recycled at home, don't throw it in the recycling bin and hope for the best. </p>
            <p class="normal">Wishcycling is the practice of putting something in the recycling bin in the hope that it will be recycled, even though it might be unsuitable, contaminated or only partially recyclable. </p>
            <p class="normal">This can lead to the whole lot being sent to landfill - even the items that can be recycled.</p>
            <p class="quote"> &ldquo; If you are uncertain about an item, it is preferable to place it in your general waste. &rdquo;</p>
            <p class="normal">It also pushes up the costs for recycling centres and can lead to delays. If a non-recyclable item enters the sorting process, it can lead to obstructions or even damage to the machinery, leading to delays, and consequently massive backlogs in the volumes of &lsquo;recyclate&rsquo; waiting to be processed.</p>
            <p class="normal">So always check what your local authority accepts, or ask a friendly neighbour, before throwing an item away.</p>
            <p class="normal">And if you are uncertain about an item, it is preferable to place it in your general waste.</p>
